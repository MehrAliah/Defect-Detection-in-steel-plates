DATASET DESCRIPTION

I used the NEU Surface Defect Database which is available in kaggle. The dataset contains a total of 1,800 grayscale images, with six different types of surface defects with each defect type consisting of 300 images. The images have a resolution of 200x200 pixels and are stored in the PNG format. 

The six types of surface defects included in the dataset are:

1. Crazing
2. Inclusion
3. Patches
